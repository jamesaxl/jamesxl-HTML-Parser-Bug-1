<h2 id="about_site">About this Site</h2>
<p>
Hi all, and welcome to the personal website of
<a href="personal.html"><b>Shlomi Fish</b></a>. I
am an Israeli software developer, and writer of stories, articles, essays, and
presentations.
</p>
<p>
You can explore the site using the <a href="#navbar"><b>navigation bar</b></a>
to the
left. Alternatively, you can traverse it page-by-page using the <b>arrows at
the top</b>. There’s also <a href="#news">a <b>news feed</b></a> for what is
new on the site, which is updated periodically.
</p>
<p>
Here are some of the things you can find here:
</p>
<h3 id="humour"><a href="humour/">Humour</a></h3>
<p>
You can read many <a href="./humour/bits/">shorter bits</a>
I have written, a <a href="./humour.html">collection of
original aphorisms and quotes</a>,
<a href="./humour/bits/facts/">factoids</a> about people
and things (Chuck Norris/etc.), and
<a href="./humour/fortunes/">a large collection of quotes</a> by
myself and others.
</p>
<p>
If you do not lack the patience for reading longer texts, you can read
<a href="./humour/stories">large-scope humorous
stories (novellas) and screenplays</a>, which I have written. The first
one is
<a href="./humour/TheEnemy/"><i>The Enemy
and How I Helped to Fight It</i></a>, which is a political
satire, inspired by Middle Eastern politics, but with more universal
messages. I also wrote <a href="./humour/TOWTF/"><i>The One with the
Fountainhead</i></a>, an episode of the television show <i>Friends</i>
which parodies the book <i>The Fountainhead</i> by Ayn Rand. I consider it my
funniest piece yet. You can also read
<a href="./humour/human-hacking/"><i>The Human
Hacking Field Guide</i></a>, which is a not-so-realistic realism about
teenagers who are open-source enthusiasts, but with many jokes.
</p>
<p>
<a href="./humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: “We,
the Living Dead”</a> is a screenplay for a
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i> episode, in which the true essence of the
Q Continuum is revealed, and we meet Living Dead, “Vampires” and Qs. The
screenplay <a href="./humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><i>Selina Mandrake -
The Slayer</i></a> is a Buffy parody, in which Selina Mandrake, a female
Anglo-American high school senior in 2011-2012, discovers she is none
other than The Slayer, and a lot of fun ensues. It has many ties with
“We, the Living Dead”.
</p>
<p>
The last screenplay that I completed is
<a href="./humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><i>Summerschool
at the NSA</i></a>, in which two Hollywood actresses conspire to kick the
ass of the NSA, using special warfare that is completely non-violent.
</p>
<p>
I have some other unfinished stories.
</p>
<h3 id="philosophy"><a href="philosophy/">Articles and Essays</a></h3>
<p>
You can read various essays and articles I wrote about politics, software
development and software management, the Internet, psychology, and ideology.
</p>
<h3 id="open-source"><a href="open-source/">Open Source Software</a></h3>
<p>
Links to software I wrote, and some resources with links to other software.
Knock yourself out!
</p>
<h3 id="presentations"><a href="lecture/">Presentations</a></h3>
<p>
You can find several technical presentations I have written or maintain
here. Especially recommended is the
<a href="lecture/Perl/Newbies/"><i>Perl for Newbies</i> series</a>
introducing <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">the Perl programming
language</a> to absolute beginners.
</p>
<h3 id="puzzles"><a href="puzzles/">Puzzles and Riddles</a></h3>
<p>
Some pages with <a href="MathVentures/">Mathematical problems</a>,
with <a href="puzzles/logic/">Logic puzzles</a> and with other riddles. Some
of these pages require a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>-enabled
browser.
</p>
<h3 id="computer_art"><a href="art/">Computer Art</a></h3>
<p>
You can find my lame attempts for art which I prepared, in
<a href="art/">the art section</a> which includes graphic designs, photographs,
and one piece of music.
</p>
<h3 id="links"><a href="links.html">Links</a></h3>
<p>
There are many links on the site, but I also concentrated many of them in
one place. Who doesn’t like links?
</p>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
<p>
I hope you enjoy my web-site. If you do, please
<a href="./meta/how-to-help/">link here</a>, recommend
it to your friends, and <a href="./me/contact-me/">drop me a line</a>
that you enjoyed it.

Here are the recent updates for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi

<p>
There is
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/The-Earth-Angel/">a new story</a>
titled <i>The Earth Angel</i> which I have started to write:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Alan Stein (Attn.) had not seen that side of Samantha before. As they sat
there in the Chinese restaurant, two days before Ari, their system
administrator, left for a trip to Israel, Samantha was emitting a lot of
profanity, and sharing her frustrations of her life and the world. Dr. Stein
was beginning to regret the fact that he had agreed to comply with Ari’s wishes,
and invite her to lunch with them.
</p>
<p>Samantha Rodriguez was the newest hire at Alan’s law firm - a brilliant
attorney in her early thirties, who looked great, was always groomed,
and got a lot of work done, despite the fact that she almost never stayed
overtime, and also took many days off. One fly in the ointment was the
fact that she was single, sexy, and kept asking her co-workers out on dates,
or accepting their own invitations. As much as Dr. Stein agreed that she had
been a good hire, he was desperately trying to avoid interacting with her.
</p>
<p>“Anyway, I ended up telling my friend, Jasmine, who can be a real bitch
sometimes, to fuck off, and deal with her troubled life herself. I simply
ran out of patience.” she said.
</p>
<p>“Bravo!” Ari said while clapping his hands. “By the way, Samantha, how did
you become a lawyer?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, that's a long story.” she said while playing with her fork.
</p>
<p>“And we’ve got time to hear it, right Mr. Stein?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, I guess we do.” Dr. Stein answered.
</p>
<p>“Well, I studied Linguistics as my B.A.,” Samantha said “and by the time I
graduated, my
head was filled with vocabulary, and to a lesser extent - grammatical rules, my
heart was broken from many heartbreaks, and I didn’t know what to do with
the rest of my life. I ended up narrowing it to three options: 1. Find
a paying job - as a programmer or whatever else I could land. 2. Stay in the
academia, studying for a Masters and/or a Ph.D. and — 3. Go to law school.
I figured out fucking Med School was never my thing.”
</p>
<p>“Anyway, after consulting it with my friends, I became even less capable
of knowing what to do. So I did the logical thing - I rolled a die.”
</p>
<p>“A die?” Ari said.
</p>
<p>“Yes, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-sided_die" xml:space="preserve">ten-sided die</a> or
a 1d10 in role-playing game parlance. That’s usually what I use. It landed
on the law school option, so that’s what I decided to pursue.” Samantha said.
</p>
<p>“So, you placed your fate in the hand of chance?” Ari asked
</p>
<p>“Yes, I did. Nothing wrong with doing that, if you ask me.”
</p>
<p>“Well, everyone say you are an excellent attorney.” Ari noted.
</p>
<p>“So they do.” Samantha said, “Maybe they are right.”
</p>

<p>
The translation of the already written part of my story,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/"><i>The
Pope Died on Sunday</i></a> is now complete:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rachel contemplated how to start the conversation.
</p>
<p>“So how did you become an infrastructures engineer?” Rachel asked.
</p>
<p>“Well, ever since I was young, I wanted to be a plumber.” Greg replied.
</p>
<p>“A plumber? Seriously?” Rachel said with astonishment.
</p>
<p>“Yes. Very strange, but what can I do — that is what I wanted to be.” Greg
said, “I spent a large part of the summer vacations being an apprentice for
plumbers and enjoyed every moment. Anyway, after I graduated from high school,
I was planning to go through a plumbing training course and to get my
qualification. But my father approached me and told me: ‘Greg, my son, I have,
thank God, enough money so you study what you want in university. So why not
exploit that? If you want, you can become a plumber who graduated from
university.’”
</p>
<p>And he went on: “So I agreed with him, but decided to study the closest
thing to plumbing: civil engineering with a specialisation in the engineering
of water and sewerage infrastructures. And surprisingly I realised that
a large part of it was quite interesting.”
</p>
<p>“So did you become a qualified plumber eventually?” Rachel queried.
</p>
<p>“Yes, I passed the course. But I still got a Bachelor’s degree in civil
engineering and that’s what I prefer to do.”
</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” Rachel said “Finding a good plumber in this day and age, to say nothing
of one who is a university graduate, is hard.”
</p>
<p>“Well, I cannot testify that I’m a good plumber. A person cannot testify for
his own qualities.” Greg replied.
</p>
<p>“Well, even a bad plumber is good enough for certain needs.” said
Rachel and witnessed Greg bursting into laughter.

<p><strong>Selina:</strong> Emeth. <span>[= "True."]</span></p>
<p><strong>Selina:</strong> BTW, are you actually Mosheh Ben-Amram (= Moses) the Hebrew prophet?

Due to the spectacular commercial success of Freecell Solver Enterprises™’s

and its
<a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.com/2011/03/freecell-solver-goes-webscale.html">Webscale™ edition</a>,
we have amassed quite a bit of cash in the bank, so we decided to make
a small but important strategical acquisition. As a result, Freecell Solver
Enterprises™ is proud to announce its upcoming acquisition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google Inc.</a>, which
will result in an exciting synergic merger.
</p>
<p>
Some of the upcoming changes would be replacing Google’s tech support
(which is notoriously bad) by Freecell Solver Enterprises™’s world-famous and
superb tech support (as detailed in the essay
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">“Seven
    steps to remarkable customer service”</a> by Joel on Software), as well
as integrating Google search into

<p>
During the Middle Ages, the apprentices of craftsmen graduated to become
masters, and started their own shops, at a much younger age
than 18. Today, most people graduate from high school at that age,
and are expected to remain disadvantaged until then. There isn’t a
good reason why the youth of today should not be able
to make useful contributions to arts, sciences, philosophy, and
entertainment, despite their young age and inexperience.

<blockquote>
<p> An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates.
St. Peter checks his dossier and says, “Ah, you’re an
engineer. You are in the wrong place.” </p>
<p> So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is
let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied
with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing
and building improvements. After a while, they’ve got
air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and
the engineer is a pretty popular guy. </p>
<p> One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says
with a sneer, “So, how’s it going down there in hell?”
</p>
<p> Satan replies, “Hey, things are going great. We’ve got
air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and
there’s no telling what this engineer is going to come
up with next.” </p>
<p> God replies, “What? You’ve got an engineer? That’s a
mistake. He should never have gotten down there; send
him up here.” </p>
<p> Satan says, “No way. I like having an engineer on the
staff, and I’m keeping him.” </p>
<p> God says, “Send him back up here or I’ll sue.” </p>
<p> Satan laughs uproariously and answers, “Yeah, right.
And just where are you going to get a lawyer?” </p>

is in a usable condition. The Hollywood
actresses Sarah Michelle Gellar (of Buffy fame) and Summer Glau (of xkcd
notability) conspire to kick the ass of the NSA (= the United States
government’s National Security Agency), while using special warfare
that is completely non-violent:

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">UNIX-like fortune cookies’ collections</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I recall discussing Buffy with a Jewish American friend,
who used to be secular, and now has become an observant
Jew, and married a woman who properly converted to
Orthodox Judaism, and they have some children. We
discussed the fact
that Sarah Michelle Gellar was Jewish, and yet that many
men (and some Lesbian women) were more attracted to Alyson
Hannigan’s character, Willow Rosenberg, who was a shy and
sheepish, redhead, Jewess. Then when I mentioned that
Hannigan was only a maternal Jew, he said she is “kosher”
(because someone whose mother is Jewish and who did not
convert to a different religion, is a bona-fide Jew). I
found it amusing that you refer to women by the same word
as you do to food, but I think the ancient Hebrew word
"kasher" also means "approved", "appropriate", "legal",
etc.
</p>
<p>
In any case, both Hannigan and Gellar are now married,
and so trying to separate between them and their husbands
is not kosher. ;-)
</p>

<p>
Finally, the main navigation menu sports a new and more usable CSS style thanks
to the great work of <a href="http://joecrawford.com/">Joe Crawford</a>. Thanks,
Joe!

<p>
Here are the recent updates for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi
Fish’s Homepage</a>. This time, the highlight is a lot of interesting new
content.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
I have started writing a comprehensive essay
titled
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
    all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</a>, which is also syndicated as
<a href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/2109.html">a blog post</a> on my
<i>Unarmed but Still Dangerous</i> blog. Here is the abstract for it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What is the problem with the Technion and why is it graver in M.I.T., and
why you should watch the film
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook"><i>Silver
Linings Playbook</i></a> to realise why it's
not a problem? Why was the David who fought Goliath a hacker, and what is the
difference between a tragic hero and an action hero? What was the second major
battle that Chuck Norris lost? What are the machines that can give us
questions (and lots of them)? Why not exerting a mental effort will make
matters go from bad to worse? Who was the Jennifer Lawrence of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_1.0">Web 1.0</a>? And
what were my two greatest mistakes, which you should not duplicate?
</p>
<p>
I got tired of truly intellectual people like me speaking in riddles
all the time and kinda lying to themselves and to others in their artworks,
and hiding a lot of what they know, so I decided to put all the cards I have
now on the table in a big tour-de-force. It's not finished yet, but still
usable, and there's more to come. Not a perfect essay, and not for everyone,
but imperfect and sweet.
</p>

<p>
There is an ongoing
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/The-Pope-Died-on-Sunday--English-Text.html">English translation</a> of
my old and incomplete story
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/">“The Pope Died on Sunday”</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Much more text has been added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><i>Selina Mandrake
- The Slayer</i></a> (a Buffy parody) and it is now in a usable condition:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[
There are three young men dressed as Klingons who fight with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat%27leth">Bat’leth</a> in the park.
Selina is passing by and shakes her head in disapproval. The three notice Selina,
and quickly run to her.
]
</p>
<p><strong>Warrior #1:</strong> Hail The Slayer, we are but your humble slaves!
</p>
<p><strong>Selina:</strong> <span>[Shocked]</span> And who might you be?
</p>
<p><strong>Warrior #1:</strong> We are The Three - three vampire brother warriors, who have been
fighting since the dawn of time.
</p>
<p><strong>Selina:</strong> And you are Klingons…
</p>
<p><strong>Warrior #2:</strong> We can assume any form.
</p>
<p><strong>Warrior #1:</strong> Yes, we can fight using any weapon, and we are masters of them
all.
</p>
<p><strong>Selina:</strong> so you can fight with something that’s not a Bat’leth?
</p>
<p><strong>Warrior #1:</strong> Of course, for example, we could fight using the Huge Sword!
</p>
<p><strong>Warrior #2 and Warrior #3:</strong> Yeah, the Huge Sword!
</p>
<p><strong>The Three:</strong> <span>[in unison]</span> Huge Sword!
</p>
<p>
[
Warrior #1 snaps his fingers, and some of these ridiculously large swords
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of
Warcraft</a>
appear on the ground.
]
</p>
<p><strong>Selina:</strong> Wow, can you fight using them?
</p>
<p><strong>The Three:</strong> <span>[non-dramatically]</span> Eh, eh, we cannot lift them.
</p>
<p><strong>Selina:</strong> Guess not. <span>[Puts her palm on her eyes.]</span> Maybe try something smaller
and not as heavy.
</p>

<p>
In addition, there are many enhancements to the section of the page, including
a page about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html">who
I think should play the characters in the screenplay</a>, and

<p>
There are two new pages with facts about people and things:

<li>
<p>
The NSA knows what you did last summer. But no one, in the NSA or outside it, knows why they should.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The more the NSA think, the less they want to be able to think. So they think
less and less.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
First the NSA ignores “silly” Internet memes, then they laugh at them, then
they are unable to fight them, and then they lose.

<div class="news_item"><h3 class="newsitem" id="shlomifish.org_news_2012_12_28">28-Dec-2012: What’s New on Shlomi Fish’s Homepage</h3>
<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. Most of the work this
time was done on the look, feel, and infrastructure of the site, such as the
navigation menus, but there is still some new (and hopefully interesting)
content. So without further ado, here is what is new:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
The main navigation menu to the right now comprises of most of the pages that
were navigable and previously were present only in the section navigation menus.
Since its HTML markup was quite excessive, I decided to load most of the
content using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a> (=
“Asyncrhonous JavaScript And XML” or “XMLHTTPRequest”) fetch of a JSON
document, while keeping a smaller subset still usable as plain HTML for
browsers with JavaScript disabled and for search engines and other web user
agents.
</p>
<p>
I made sure that the expansion state of the navigation menu is preserved
between the pages. Moreover, the much maligned section navigation menus are now
hidden by default, but can be enabled using the button and should remember
their state between pages.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There is a new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/HTML-Tutorial/">HTML Tutorial in Hebrew</a>
under work. Currently, there is only one section, and some aspects of it are lacking.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There is a new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/text-processing-tools/">list
of text processing tools</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/networking-clients/">a list of networking clients</a> in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/">software
resources section</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I added new quotes to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookies collection</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Yaakov: </b>I LOVE YOU ALL WITH A GREAT HUGE LOVE</li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>Yaakov: HOW MUCH DOES YOUR GREAT HUGE LOVE COST?</li>
<li><b>Yaakov: </b>It&#39;s on offer half price today.</li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>Yaakov: I WILL OFFER YOU 200,000 VIRTUAL DOLLARS FOR YOUR GREAT HUGE LOVE.</li>
<li><b>Yaakov: </b>The regular price is free of charge.</li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>Yaakov: oh nice.</li>
<li><i>* rindolf buys Yaakov&#39;s GREAT HUGE LOVE.</i></li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>I LOVE YOU ALL WITH YAAKOV&#39;S GREAT HUGE LOVE.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>
The third version of my essay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">“Open source,
Free software, and Other Beasts”</a> is now live. It was converted from
DocBook 4 to DocBook 5 and greatly enhanced.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Also new is the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/countdown/">countdown
program</a> which is similar to the UNIX sleep command, only displays the
amount of time remaining.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There’s a new and open source
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/japanese-puzzle-games/binary-puzzle/">solver for the so-called “Binary Puzzles”</a>. It is still
incomplete.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There is a new geek song parody (under work) titled
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Can-I-SCO-Now/">“Can I SCO Now?”</a> sang to
the music of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx4YdVmhwoM">Jennifer Love Hewitt’s “Can I Go Now?”</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Can I SCO now?<br />
Sue who you wanna sue,<br />
it doesn't matter anyhoo,<br />
it's time to litigate.<br />
Can I SCO Now?<br />
Say what you wanna say,<br />
we don't care anyway,<br />
we're going to inflate.
</p>
<p>
Can I, can I, SCO now….
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I now mirror <i>The Fountainhead</i>’s parody
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/the-fountainhead-starring-skull-force/">“The Fountainhead
Starring Skull Force”</a>, whose original link went offline, but which I was able to find a mirror of. Enjoy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are now <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/java/">a page
with some links against Java</a>
and <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/SOAP/">a page
with some links against “SOAP”</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for the <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax
JavaScript library</a> was added to the pages in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/MathVentures/">MathVentures section</a>
enabling most modern JavaScript-enabled browsers to pretty view the mathematical
formulae there.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are some
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#english-wikipedia-1">new
additions to the original Aphorisms and Quotes page</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The English Wikipedia: now you don’t see it - now you do.

<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. The first item of
note is that I implemented an automated test suite for the site, with a
test for lack of trailing whitespace, and a spell checking test
(powered by
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Text::Hunspell">Text::Hunspell</a> and
<a href="http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/">Hunspell</a>). The many problems
pointed by these checkers were fixed, resulting in a very large patch to
review this time.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the spelling corrections, here are the items of interest:
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/">meta section</a> now
has a section navigation menu.
</p>
<p>
I added the incomplete geek parody song
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Im-The-Real-Tim-Toady/">“I’m
    the Real Tim Toady”</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    May I have your attention, please?<br />
    May I have your attention, please?<br />
    Will the real Tim Toady please match up?<br />
    I repeat: will the real Tim Toady please match up?<br />
    We’re going to have two problems here.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
jnoakes’ page about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/grad-student-jokes-from-jnoakes/">Graduate
    Student Jokes</a>, which I have enjoyed, and which has gone offline,
has been restored on the site:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>You know you’re a grad student when…</b></p>
<ul>
<li>you can identify universities by their internet domains. </li>
<li>you are constantly looking for a thesis in novels. </li>
<li>you have difficulty reading anything that doesn't have footnotes. </li>
<li>you understand jokes about Foucault. </li>
<li>the concept of free time scares you. </li>
<li>you consider caffeine to be a major food group. </li>
<li>you've ever brought books with you on vacation and actually studied. </li>
<li>Saturday nights spent studying no longer seem weird. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/text-processing-tools/">A
page with a List of Text Processing Tools</a> has been added to the software
resources sub-section.
</p>
<p>
There are new additions to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html">Aphorisms and quotes collection</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If it isn’t in my E-mail, it doesn’t exist. And if the whole world says one
thing and E-mail says another, Email will conquer
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Said to me in a private conversation by an Israeli Linux enthusiast.)</p>
<p>
There are also some new quotes in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Chuck Norris is the reason why the Knights who until Recently Said “Ni”, are no
longer saying “Ni”.

<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. There are quite a few
changes this time.
</p>
<p>
The humorous document
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/It-s-not-a-Fooware-It-s-an-Operating-System/">“It’s
    not a Fooware - it’s an Operating System.”</a>, mostly written
by me, was restored from the perl.net.au wiki which is currently down:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Lots of people heard Emacs haters complain that “Emacs is not an editor - it’s
an operating system” or something along these lines. So here we're trying to
concentrate other such programs that are no longer limited only to their
original purpose, but rather expanded to cover lots of other stuff. So you'll
know that Emacs is not alone.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I also added a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#We_agree">a new
    aphorism</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    We agree. But do we agree to agree?

mountain. If the mountain will not come to Chuck Norris, then the mountain will
suffer Norris’s wrath for not complying with his whims.

I found many typos in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/lecture5/">fifth part
    of the Perl for Perl Newbies series</a> before and during giving the talk
at the <a href="http://telaviv.pm.org/">Tel Aviv Perl Mongers</a> and also
prepared some notes for it in Hebrew (which can be found in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/">series’s front
    page</a>).
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/by-others/perlcast-transcript--tom-limoncelli-interview/">Transcript of the Perlcast interview with
    Tom Limoncelli</a>, about his book <i>Time Management for System
    Administrators</i> has been restored from the currently offline perl.net.au
wiki:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Josh</b>: Getting back to where we had started on that planning your day at
the beginning of the day, before you check your email. You claim there, that
whenever you're prioritising your activities, you really only need three
categories and not, you know, a top-ten list, or anything like that. Could you
explain that a little?
</p>
<p>
<b>Tom Limoncelli</b>: that comes from the fact that I used to try to really be
specific about the priorities of my action items. So I put something in my
to-do-list, and I'd say well, you know I'm ranking their importance from 0 is
not important, and a 100 is the world is going to explode if I don't do it
right now. And I spent so much time calculating "Wow, is this more like a 63 or
a 67, is it a 67? Wow!". And I just spent so much time trying to get an exact
priority. In some cases, the task would have been done already. You know I've
spent too much time prioritising.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure where I picked this up, but someone recommended three priorities:
A - it's due today; B - it's important; and C - everything else. Generally, if
it's a day where I have any A's at all - that's all I'll be working on. And the
way projects go, I'm generally working on that for the whole day. So that's
sort of the exception. Most of the time I'm working on B's, which are things
that are important, and C's are sort of those would-be-nice-kind-of-things.
</p>
<p>
And the nice thing about breaking it into this a simple A, B, C priority scheme
is that first of all, you're spending less time picking your priority. And
secondly, when you're planning your day, in that 5-minute planning period, you
can look at your tasks and say "You know, I wanna work 8 hours today, I have
one hour of meetings, so I'm down to 7 hours", and then you can look at your
tasks and say "Is this more than 7 hours worth of work?". Because it's written,
I can start actually doing this kind of planning, and say "That's more like 14
hours worth of work, so those C priorities and B priorities - I'm gonna move
them to the next day's to-do-list." Or maybe, OK, I have time for my A's and my
B's and the C's get moved.

<p>
The third version of my essay,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">“The
    Case for Drug Legalisation”</a>, is now live, with several major
improvements. They are in large part, thanks to someone who commented on my
essay, and allowed me to use their text, and who chose to remain anonymous.
</p>
<p>
I have set up project pages for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/mikmod/">MikMod, a
    module files player</a>, which I now maintain, and for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/website-meta-language/">Website
    META Language</a>, a sophisticated HTML preprocessor, which I have also
been maintaining and recently released its 2.2.0 version.
</p>
<p>
Also in the software section is a
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/how-to-contribute-to-my-projects/">How
    to Contribute to my Projects</a> sub-section with a concentrated and
ongoing “HACKING” document.
</p>
<p>
And, naturally, there are also many smaller enhancements, such as new links,
fixes for broken links, new <tt>&lt;meta name="description" /&gt;</tt>
tags, and corrections of typos. I’ve also moved the site’s version control
repository from a Subversion repository that required a username and password
to access to a
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage">publicly-accessible
Mercurial repository</a>. More details can be found on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/site-source/">the Site's Source Code
page</a>.
